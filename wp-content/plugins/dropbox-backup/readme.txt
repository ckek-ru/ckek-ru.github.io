* Vulnerabilities of user files, WordPress files, WordPress plugin  and theme  files;
* Websites hacking, Websites trojans etc.;

= Hacks and tips =


It is obvious and true, that in order to sleep calm and be sure in the future of your online business, it is neccessary to secure yourself with regular copies of your website content. Using www.webpage-backup.com service you can make a copy of files or database of any of your projects without distinction either it is a simple website or woocommerce shop. From security point of view,  it is important to schedule regular backups, thereby not to lose your content or comments from your databases in case of any trouble. With this online service you can select the folder or special databases that you want to copy and save or just a single website inside your hosting. But for our service it does not matter if the files are large or small, in case of the restoration it is the same.  Concerning the local backup which is done on your hosting. If your hosting has enough space it is ok, but it is not recommended and does not provide 100% security for your files, because it is possible that something may happen with your hosting or after some time you want to change your hosting provider. You should remember one truth, if you create secure copies of the site regularly and has limited storage, sooner or later its size will get full and it will not allow to save website copies anymore. Keep it in mind, please. For this reason the best is to use the Dropbox storage. Dropbox storage is scalable and you can remove unnecessary info from it easily, thus clearing some space. You can make it manually and for free. Moreover, cloud storage is more secure than hosting. You do not have to upload your dropbox site security copy on your PC, as the plugin allows to restore it directly from dropbox drive clicking just one button in the plugin. Independently of our service it is possible to download, upload the data from the dropbox account. In order to clone, migrate or copy a site, it is important to have correct access permissions for folders and files to write is the same as permission to access the folder or to uploading it. To perform any task with this tool, it does not matter if your site has SSL certificate or it is normal woocommerce shop without SSL certificate. For our  www.webpage-backup.com service it is important that it has permissions to the folders and to the cloud drive. 

= Special functions =

= Special functions =
Migration, back up scheduling, cron backup, wpmu backup, and encryption by cloning, website or multisite cloning - all these features  belong to the special features. Online service www.webpage-backup.com. allows to perform multisites secure copies from one place. Addons for your pages or multisite (WPMU) peges you can add inside of your service account if you want.  But for some of this function it is required to register on www.webpage-backup.com to be able to manage multisites or just for one page menaging, for cron and scheduled dropbox backup as for full restoration of you WooCommerce shop, website or multisite as well as for migration. It is not possible to make  full restoration of website from dropbox copy  without the WordPress site itself. 

= Easy backup =

This Dropbox Full Backup plugin has easy intuitive interface that was created both for ordinary users, not experts without any superb knowledge and multisites owners, and for experts, webmasters ans programmers. For experts we have a special  explorer where the expert can select or exclude files and folders from backup creation. As the registered user you can use multiple dropbox accounts or create other multisite clouds, as FTP. All automatic functions are inside of our service. To automatic tools belong: cron and scheduler, migrator and remote. Scheduled tasks for dropbox you can setup in our calendar, where it is possible to appomt particulat days and time when you want to perform the task. 

= Back Up, сloning, duplicate or migrate of websites =

Cloning, duplicate or migration in principal means the same process when you move the site from one hosting provider to another one . The process is automatic and requires just several easy clicks from you. It gives you the possibility quickly  clone website with  “templates” for multiple site.  This clone tool is very useful, if you have more than one website or, if you want to clone or duplicate your web page. You can migrate from old site or WooCommerce shop to a new one with this plugin clicking on one button, only if you have previously made backup of your old website. All multisite functions are available from one dashboard of cloning tool, as well as WPMU backup in the same cloud or in several cloud storages of hosting provider or just server. From the same dashboard are available cloning functions separately or in bundle. Using this  plugin you can make it without expert knowledge. Clone add-ons allow your easy backup or migrate your website or WPMU (multisite).

= Easy data restoring = 

To recover your website (or multisite) select necessary back-up with the data of its type, date and size. In case of cloning you restore your old website copy on new wordpress installation. Website movement  looks almost the same as a simple site recovery, but requires some more steps. With our file explorer you can match every file separately for restoration. In case of recovering process only these files will be recovered. You cannot restore one file than the next, the plugin provides full website restoration. The restoration time depends from your hosting and upload rate, the file size. Current plugin does not support scheduled restore, unless somebody send a special inquiry on our service to implement scheduled recovering. The recover from the Dropbox cloud storage takes time, depending on the web site size and access permissions of the folders of your hosting provider. 


= Is it vital to backup website to remote Dropbox storage? 
<p>In the age of trend-setting technologies, backuping is necessary for many life spheres that are related in any way for creation of something. That refers to programming, site building, engineering, designing, not to mention ordinary home data - photos, videos and other stuff. This list can go on and on… One would think, what is so special about this backing up thing? Well, the one fact known for sure is that it saves lives of both: different projects and people who fagged away at these very same projects.</p>
<p>It has been said all the time that everyone should make the reserve copy, but not many actually do that, and besides, there are even those who have no clue about it and what it is for. Nevertheless, information about this procesure is really an important and useful habit, so let’s know what’s what about it.</p>
<p>Firstly, there’s a need to determine the back up process – it is a data redundancy to different storage devices, making copies of the existing data. Now let’s clear its usefulness to each and every. On the one hand, modern computers and their hard drives, which are the major and the most popular data storage places, have attained quite dramatic reliability numbers. Multiform redundant coding on different levels of data management provides strong security from the possible sad situations when the information is damaged as a result of accidental error in the act of data saving. But on the second hand thought, even the most dependable storage mediums sooner or later go down, and for what is more, it usually happens all of the sudden. Now that is the break point, when you finally change your mind upon all the information kept by people on their hard discs. Passwords and contacts, momentous pictures and rare music collections, all possible working data – this whole treasure can disappear without warning from your website, which can turn to serious financial and time losses in addition to emotional stress.</p>
<p>The easiest variant is to simply copy data to another folder on a hard drive. But unfortunately, that is an unreliable decision, because that would release you from only the small number of possible problems, even if this folder is placed on another hardware. Now you are aware that at the present digital information day creating of reserve cope of the whole website is neither a whim nor extra precaution, this is a plain safety measure.</p>

= What to do if site recover fails? =

First of all, check the data spelling. It is the most common mistake. Other common mistakes that may occur during the recovering are: 

* to recover from wrong or damaged cloud storage account;
* if done just a database back up – not full and you can't see the recovering site;
* during the  recovering process there was an interrupted or lost internet connection;
* In your database there are file exclusions;
* your database backuping was not consistent;
* file archive of reserve copy with a broken checksum;
* misspelled back up due to user failed restore; 

Large file and big size databases takes more time to get backed up or recovered. It can take until two hours or more, depends on the size of your database, but for our recovery service it doesn’t matter for uploading of large files or small files. The only difference between restoring of the large files and small is the time. <br />
After checking all of these figures please  email  our support team http://www.webpage-backup.com and we will try to answer as soon as possible and to give you’re the best solution how easy to recover your site.

If you see any 5xx error codes, as a return from your backuping procedure:<br />
please, do not hesitate to contact your own system administrator (admins, support etc.), because this type of errors come from your server.<br />

**The regular creation of website reserve copy protects from viruses.**

There are some requirements for this:<br />
•	Make copies of your files and store them at secure remote storage regularly and as often as you can;<br />
•	Rank your data by importance backuping essential information first. Generally, temporary files only add up to the back up volume and carry no significance, so get rid of them;<br />
•	Do not store your file copies on the same hard drives;<br />
•	Make sure you can access your copied content any time and from any place;<br />
•	Schedule your backups and ensure you get informed on their status;<br />
•	If your medium capacity or bandwidth is limited use compression tools;<br />
A good solution is to have a separate server for remote site copies although it is not fail-safe. If the server is unavailable restoration will be impossible. To ensure high accessibility and data safety use cloud storage services.<br />
There are a lot of services providing free but limited cloud storage capacity  like Google Drive, Amazon S3 (AWS) or Dropbox. The problem is they do not support FTP protocol which sometimes is the most adequate way of data transfer. In comparison, virtually every host company supports this protocol.

= Restoration =
<p>Different factors may be the reason for someone to restore his data from a dropbox backup. This is a truly helpful option that supposes bringing the saved data from dropbox storage place back to its original in case you’ve lost or damaged the existing one.</p>
= Best Choice to Keep Data =
<p>Among the available ways to maintain information the first place belongs rightfully to **remote cloud storages** or **cloud drives**. These are sorts of virtual data storages, that save and manage the data via numerous servers strewn about World Wide Web. Their principle is simple: every ‘cloud’ has definitively stated limit of Gb virtual space, that is given to a new user absolutely for free. But in time, if a person wants to expand it, he’ll have to pay according to price plan. So here we have a simple case of effective advertising – a user gets used to the comfort and mobility of the network repository, and after he concludes that the cloud suits him to the full extend in every meanings, he pays for the “rent” of this sufficiency.</p>
= Advantages of Dropbox storage for WordPress =
<p>For the present day Dropbox cloud is still an unbeaten leader that comprises  multi-million clients number. Most probably that has to do with the fact that it is Dropbox that stood at the origins of virtual space providing to users, and it is the first company, that has realized the idea of remote cloud data storage. It works by creation of a virtual folder in the cloud, where  any kind of  info can be saved, the one which you download to your Dropbox folder on your computer. For the WordPress website management the best choice is to download a plugin to easily administrate your source from wordpress admin dashboard.  Backup&Restore Dropbox has many positive reviews and it deals with the performance of various tasts.</p>
<br />
<p>Dropbox Full Backup for WordPress is good for restore, migration and backup tasks. It allows to use your own App key and App secret in order to keep then private with higher security for yourself. It can be your personal guard that can keep all the files saved and backed up as much as possible, and even in case of your website data lost, you are able to restore all the data just with one click. </p>
<br />
<p>To make a conclusion we’d say, that in order to be safe and sound with any of your data of your WordPress site information you should secure yourself with backing up of an important information. That will cut possible damages to minimum and save your time and nerves.</p>
